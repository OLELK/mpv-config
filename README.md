# mpv-config
mpv player v3 config scripts &amp; hotkeys

To use these configurations go to C:\Users\rohan\AppData\Roaming\mpv this location & paste the needed .conf files
In case if you don't find this C:\Users\rohan\AppData\Roaming\mpv location, that probably means the mpv file isn't created automatically,
to solve this, you must create the mpv file first by going to C:\Users\rohan\AppData\Roaming then, you can paste the needed .confs there.
